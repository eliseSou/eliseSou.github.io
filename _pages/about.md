<p>Hello and welcome! My name is Elise Souvannavong, and I'm a 21-year-old French engineering student specializing in computer science at INSA Rouen Normandie. At this moment i am spending one semester in South Korea at Gwangju Institute of Science and Engineering as an exchange student.<br>
My passion for science has led me to pursue a career in this field, with a focus on developing innovative solutions to complex problems. In addition to my academic pursuits, I am deeply interested in climate change and its impact on our planet, as well as exploring new cultures through travel. I'm also a fan of fashion and art, and I find inspiration in the creativity and design of these fields. I'm excited to continue my journey as an engineering student and look forward to making a positive impact on the world through my work. </p>
